#### CloudWatch Metrics

**‚ÑπÔ∏è Information**: Amazon CloudWatch Metrics are time-ordered data points that provide visibility into your AWS resources and applications. These metrics are the foundation of CloudWatch's monitoring capabilities, enabling you to observe system performance, health, and operational status in real-time.

CloudWatch provides intuitive visualization tools including customizable charts and data tables that transform raw metrics into actionable insights. This visibility is essential for understanding application health, optimizing resource utilization, and making data-driven decisions about system improvements.

In this section, you will learn how to:

- Select and visualize specific metrics from your pre-configured applications
- Implement advanced metric search expressions to filter and display targeted data
- Perform metric math calculations to derive deeper insights such as aggregations, averages, and performance rankings
- Configure dynamic labels to enhance chart readability and interpretation

**üí° Pro Tip**: When working with CloudWatch Metrics, focus on establishing baseline performance patterns first. This makes it easier to identify anomalies and troubleshoot issues when they arise. Consider using metric math to calculate the percentage change from your baseline for critical metrics.
